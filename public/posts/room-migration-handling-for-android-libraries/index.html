So, that client can simply add this Entity class and Dao inside the client application Room DB setup file.\n@Entity(tableName = \"app_logs\") data class AppLogs( @PrimaryKey(autoGenerate = true) @ColumnInfo(name = \"id\") val id: Long = 0,\n@ColumnInfo(name = \"message\") val message: String,\n@ColumnInfo(name = \"logged_at\") val loggedAt: String, ..... ..... )\n@Dao interface AppLogDao {\n@Insert suspend fun insert(appLogs: AppLogs) ..... }\nAnd a Main class which extends the Timber.Tree()\nclass RoomTree( private val appLogsDao: AppLogDao, private val deleteLogsAfterDays: Int = 15 ) : Timber.Tree() {\noverride fun log(priority: Int, tag: String?, message: String, t: Throwable?) { GlobalScope.launch(IO) { appLogsDao.insert( AppLogs( message = message, loggedAt = Instant.now().toString() ...... ...... ) ) .............. .............. } } }\nTo handle the migrations when the Room Db is owned by client.\nProblem The major problem was versioning of the Room DB has a library we does not know the version in which the client is integrating our library or updating our library.\nExample:\nClient Application 1 : Already has the Room DB set up which is versioned 4 now the client application like to integrate our library then the migration file should be Migration(4, 5).\nClient Application 2 : Already has the Room DB set up which is versioned 9 now the client application like to integrate our library then the migration file should be Migration(9, 10).\nFrom this we came to know that versioning cannot be hard-coded in migration files at the same time we need to write a migration file in library.\nSolution We have created 3 functions which is responsible for handling the migrations here we does not care about the versioning of the Room DB the control of versioning is given to client but the migration query is handled by library a bit confusing right ?

<p>Have you ever wondered while creating libraries why are we having a separate Room DB implementation in library ? However we knew that client can Implement Room DB but still we create our Room DB in library Why ?</p>
<p>There are enamours reasons to create a separate Room DB for example to get full control over the Room DB etc…</p>

<h3 id="goal">Goal<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#goal">#</a></h3>
<p>Our goal is to create a library which can store all the logs in client Room DB.</p>
<p>To create a library to store logs has mentioned. We are using <a href="https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber"><strong>Timber</strong></a> library it provides the extension function to implement the custom logic when the log is triggered simply by extending the <strong>Timber.Tree()</strong> then we get the <strong>override fun log()</strong> something like below</p>
<p><code>override fun log(priority: Int, tag: String?, message: String, t: Throwable?) {</code>
<code>// Our custom logic.</code>
<code>// In our case its an insertation to room db and other business logics.</code>
<code>}</code></p>
<p>This is the overall context now comes the interesting part integrating the client Room DB to Library and Handling Room Migrations in Library.</p>
<h2 id="library-code">Library Code<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#library-code">#</a></h2>
<p>We have created the <strong>Entity class</strong> and <strong>DAO Interface</strong> in library which is exposed to client. So, that client can simply add this Entity class and Dao inside the client application Room DB setup file.</p>
<p><code>@Entity(tableName = &quot;app_logs&quot;)</code>
<code>data class AppLogs(</code>
<code>@PrimaryKey(autoGenerate = true)</code>
<code>@ColumnInfo(name = &quot;id&quot;)</code>
<code>val id: Long = 0,</code></p>
<p><code>@ColumnInfo(name = &quot;message&quot;)</code>
<code>val message: String,</code></p>
<p><code>@ColumnInfo(name = &quot;logged_at&quot;)</code>
<code>val loggedAt: String,</code>
<code>.....</code>
<code>.....</code>
<code>)</code></p>
<p><code>@Dao</code>
<code>interface AppLogDao {</code></p>
<p><code>@Insert</code>
<code>suspend fun insert(appLogs: AppLogs)</code>
<code>.....</code>
<code>}</code></p>
<p>And a Main class which extends the <strong>Timber.Tree()</strong></p>
<p><code>class RoomTree(</code>
<code>private val appLogsDao: AppLogDao,</code>
<code>private val deleteLogsAfterDays: Int = 15</code>
<code>) : Timber.Tree() {</code></p>
<p><code>override fun log(priority: Int, tag: String?, message: String, t: Throwable?) {</code>
<code>GlobalScope.launch(IO) {</code>
<code>appLogsDao.insert(</code>
<code>AppLogs(</code>
<code>message = message,</code>
<code>loggedAt = Instant.now().toString()</code>
<code>......</code>
<code>......</code>
<code>)</code>
<code>)</code>
<code>..............</code>
<code>..............</code>
<code>}</code>
<code>}</code>
<code>}</code></p>
<p>To handle the migrations when the Room Db is owned by client.</p>
<h3 id="problem">Problem<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#problem">#</a></h3>
<p>The major problem was versioning of the Room DB has a library we does not know the version in which the client is integrating our library or updating our library.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Client Application 1 : Already has the Room DB set up which is versioned 4 now the client application like to integrate our library then the migration file should be Migration(4, 5).</p>
<p>Client Application 2 : Already has the Room DB set up which is versioned 9 now the client application like to integrate our library then the migration file should be Migration(9, 10).</p>
<p>From this we came to know that versioning cannot be hard-coded in migration files at the same time we need to write a migration file in library.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="solution">Solution<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#solution">#</a></h3>
<p>We have created 3 functions which is responsible for handling the migrations here we does not care about the versioning of the Room DB the control of versioning is given to client but the migration query is handled by library a bit confusing right ? Yeah but let us see the implementation and then figure it out.</p>
<p><strong>AppLogMigration.kt</strong> file which holds the migration logic.</p>
<p><code>private const val BASE_VERSION = 1</code>
<code>private const val LATEST_VERSION = 1</code></p>
<p><code>private val versionMapping: Map&lt;Int, (SupportSQLiteDatabase) -&gt; Unit&gt; = mapOf(</code>
<code>1 to ::createAppLogMigration</code>
<code>)</code></p>
<p><code>fun appLogMigrationForIntegration(db: SupportSQLiteDatabase) {</code>
<code>for (v in BASE_VERSION..LATEST_VERSION) {</code>
<code>versionMapping[v]?.invoke(db) ?: throw IllegalArgumentException(&quot;The version$v has not mapped to any function.&quot;)</code>
<code>}</code>
<code>}</code></p>
<p><code>fun appLogMigrationBetweenVersions(</code>
<code>fromLibraryVersion: Int,</code>
<code>toLibraryVersion: Int,</code>
<code>db: SupportSQLiteDatabase</code>
<code>) {</code>
<code>for (v in fromLibraryVersion..toLibraryVersion) {</code>
<code>versionMapping[v]?.invoke(db) ?: throw IllegalArgumentException(&quot;In given range, version$v has not found.&quot;)</code>
<code>}</code>
<code>}</code></p>
<p><code>fun appLogMigrationForSpecificVersion(</code>
<code>libraryVersion: Int,</code>
<code>db: SupportSQLiteDatabase</code>
<code>) {</code>
<code>versionMapping[libraryVersion]?.invoke(db)</code>
<code>?: throw IllegalArgumentException(&quot;Version$libraryVersion not found, kindly check the doc &amp; provide valid library version.&quot;)</code>
<code>}</code></p>
<p><code>private fun createAppLogMigration(db: SupportSQLiteDatabase) {</code>
<code>db.execSQL(</code>
<code>// The Query to be executed.</code>
<code>)</code>
<code>}</code></p>
<p>Let me explain this two private const val BASE_VERSION -it will be always 1, LATEST_VERSION -it will be updated each time then the library release a version and we have a <strong>Map</strong> of version-to-function mapping based on the <strong>Library Version</strong> provided. The functions inside the map will be the private functions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For versioning we are following the <a href="https://semver.org/">Semantric Versioning</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Only 3 functions are exposed to client for handling the migration.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>appLogMigrationForIntegration</strong></p>
<p>The function name by itself self-explanatory and it takes the <strong>SupportSQLiteDatabase</strong> has a parameter to leverage the client Room DB and this function should be used on the very first time when the client is integrating the library.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>appLogMigrationBetweenVersions</strong></p>
<p>This function is responsible for handling migrations between library versions and it takes the 3 parameters <strong>fromLibraryVersion -Int, toLibraryVersion -Int, db -SupportSQLiteDatabase.</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Real world use:</p>
<p>If a client already integrated our library using our 1st migration function at the time library version is 1. Later the library released three new versions where as client is not actively following the releases or actively following but not want to upgrade the library version due to several reasons.

In this scenario client has to use 2nd function in that case the parameters will be fromLibraryVersion -1, toLibraryVersion -4 and the instance of the client Room DB.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The 1st and 2nd function will loop through the versions from Base to Latest Version and invoke the <strong>Function Reference Mapping</strong> function based on the  version. The private functions inside the map is responsible for handling the queries for the migration.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>BaseVersion(1) to LatestVersion -this various based on the function used. 1st function its always 1 to LatestVersion of the library. 2nd function the parameters will be dynamic means BaseVersion must be the library version which is used in client application its provided by the client (For instance take it has 3) and LatestVersion( Note: It’s not a libraries latest version) it is decided by client until which version client wish to upgrade the library (For instance take it has 5) but the actual LatestVersion of library can be 8 but client wish to upgrade only till the Version 5</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>appLogMigrationForSpecificVersion</strong></p>
<p>This function is used for the linear upgrade of the library it takes 2 parameters <strong>libraryVersion: Int, db: SupportSQLiteDatabase.</strong> The client will provide the libraryVersion it must be the version number which the client has upgraded the library dependency. Then it will invoke the <strong>Function Reference Mapping</strong> function based on the version provided.
